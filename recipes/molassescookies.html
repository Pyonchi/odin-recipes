        <p><h2><center>Description</center></h2></p>
        <p><center>These delicious molasses cookies are one of my favorite desserts. It's a classic recipe, but a timeless one for sure. They are especially tasty when they are warm and eaten alongside a glass of milk!</p></center>
         <p><center>It's perfect for you if you're vegetarian or allergic to nuts. You can even put them in the freezer! The yield is of about 14 cookies.</p></center>
