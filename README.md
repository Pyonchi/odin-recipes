# odin-recipes

This is the repositery for The Odin Project's recipes project that I will follow.
By the completion of this project, I should be able to build a simple website using HTML, using elements such as text, links, lists and images.
Additionally, I should be able to feel familiar enough with commit messages and their conventions.
